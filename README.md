# LLM-Explorations

This repository contains a collection of various Language Modeling model architectures implemented from scratch in PyTorch, together with a simple training script on the [Gutenberg Poetry Corpus](https://github.com/aparrish/gutenberg-poetry-corpus). This is both a learning exercise and for future exploration and experimentation with any new ideas on architecture design.

## Installation

1. Install PyTorch
2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Unzip the corpus file
```bash
gunzip gutenberg_poetry_corpus.ndjson.gz
```
